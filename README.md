# CartesianTree
Try to create a Cartesian Tree

Cartesian Tree is a kind of Binary Tree
Every node has two data key and val
The data key like Binary Search Tree and data val like heap

The elements of each node are represented by the struct couple
and nodes are represented by the struct node

尝试构造笛卡尔树

笛卡尔树是一种特殊的二叉树
它的每个节点有两个元素key和val
只看key是二叉查找树；只看val是堆

每个节点的元素用结构体couple表示

结点用node表示
